# `sim/comparator-kickback/`

**Charge kicked back into the comparator's own input nodes** by a decision,
over the full PVT grid — measured against two different source impedances,
neither of them ideal.

Backs [`README.md`'s kickback row](../../README.md#target-specification-draft--engineering-to-ratify)
(≤ 5 mV disturbance into a 1 kΩ source impedance at the input nodes, single
decision edge; ≤ 2 mV stretch). Kickback is a first-class row here, per
[`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) ("Kickback is measured, not assumed").

```bash
python3 sim/run_corners.py comparator-kickback -j 8
```

## Method

**The source impedance is the entire measurement.** Biasing the inputs from
ideal voltage sources restores the injected charge instantly and reports
≈ 0 kickback no matter how bad it is — the standard way this measurement gets
faked. Three instances, two independent drives, and both are in the record:

| instance | drive | reports |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | 1 kΩ series source, 100 fF input-node capacitance | `kick_1k_peak_mv` — **peak** disturbance of the node relative to its own driving source. This is the exact condition the spec row states. |
| **B** | 1 pF node through 1 GΩ, 1 mV residue | `kick_resid_small_nv` — **residual** charge left after the decision. RC = 1 ms against the strobe cycle: the bias sets the operating point and then does nothing. |
| **C** | same, 100 mV residue | the same, at a large residue |

**Only the signal-dependent part is irreducible.** A residue-*independent*
kick is indistinguishable from comparator offset and is removed the same way;
`kick_sigdep_nv = |kick(100 mV) − kick(1 mV)|` isolates the part that is not.

Every instance's decision is checked (`dout_*_end`), because a comparator
whose own kickback pushed its input past the decision point would fail in a
way the displacement numbers alone cannot show.

### Beating the `meas` resolution floor

ngspice's `meas`/`let`+`print` machinery returns roughly six significant
digits, so differencing two ~1.2 V node levels quantizes the answer at
**~1 µV** — which for a well-isolated input stage is coarser than the
quantity being measured. That floor is a property of the tool, and
tightening `reltol`/`vntol`/`abstol` does not move it (see
`sim/harness/README.md` "Known measurement floors").

The methodology's own upstream (`gf180-sar-adc`, via `gf180-comparator`)
documents this floor and states the way past it: measure a quantity that is
*already* small. This bench does that. `Bbd`/`Bcd`/`Bbc` compute the
differential (and common-mode-referred) input voltages as behavioural nodes
sitting near 0 V, so `meas` returns six digits **of the small quantity** and
the floor drops to ~1 nV.

Both forms are reported, deliberately:

| measurement | resolution |
|---|---|
| `kick_resid_raw_uv` | the naive node difference — quantized at ~1 µV, every value an exact integer number of µV |
| `kick_resid_small_nv` | the same physical quantity, near-zero-referenced — ~1000× finer |

So the floor is *visible in the record* rather than asserted in prose.

Mismatch is off (this bench runs the `mos` corner set, not `mos_mismatch` —
see `sim/harness/corners.py`): kickback and offset are separable and are
budgeted separately.

## Provenance

Methodology ported from
[`gf180-comparator/sim/comparator-kickback/`](https://github.com/2AMLogic/gf180-comparator/tree/main/sim/comparator-kickback)
(itself ported from `gf180-sar-adc`), per
[`spec/porting-plan.md`](../../spec/porting-plan.md) and issue #8.

**Ported:** the floating high-impedance drive and the explicit reason for it
(an ideal source reports ≈ 0 kickback however bad the circuit is); separating
the signal-dependent component from the absolute one, and the argument that
only the former is irreducible; reporting the peak transient excursion
separately from the residual displacement; quoting the residual as charge as
well as voltage so a reader with a different input capacitance can rescale
it; checking that every instance still decides correctly while being
disturbed; the tightened solver tolerances (`abstol=1e-15`, `chgtol=1e-16`);
the `meas` result-precision floor and its remedy — including **acting on**
it, not merely restating it.

**Deliberately NOT ported:**

- **The topology and its sizing**, and any upstream numeric result.
- **The CDAC top-plate capacitance.** There is no CDAC here: the floating
  node is a stated 1 pF, and the *primary* drive is the 1 kΩ source impedance
  this repo's own spec row names — which the SAR-ADC upstream's bench does
  not have at all, because its comparator is never driven from a resistive
  source.
- **Everything expressed in LSB** (`kick_sigdep_lsb`, `kick_diff_small_lsb`).
  A standalone comparator has no LSB; all bounds here are in volts (or
  attocoulombs).
- **The bit-cycle timing.** Those are SAR bit-trial instants. The strobe here
  is placed only to leave every node settled before the decision.
- **The `dout` correctness check phrased as "must still decide with the CDAC
  floating"**, retained in substance but re-anchored: here it is "must still
  decide while its own kickback disturbs a 1 kΩ-driven input", which is the
  condition this repo's row is written against.

## Records

Not yet minted — see `sim/README.md`'s Experiments table for the one-command
cold start (`sim/characterize.sh characterize`). This section is updated
with the first committed 45-point record's id, DUT and verdict once it
lands; that record is also what the `kick_1k_peak_mv` per-axis floors above
are calibrated from.

**Read the banner on any record here before citing it.** Every record taken
against `sim/dut.json`'s current `placeholder-v1` binding substantiates the
harness, not the kickback row.

**Placeholder caveat.** The coupling from the placeholder's decision stage
back to its front end is an explicit 5 fF/side stand-in for a real latch
input pair's `C_gd`, declared in
[`sim/dut/placeholder_comparator.spice`](../dut/placeholder_comparator.spice),
not an extracted capacitance. The numbers exercise the measurement path end
to end; they characterise no real topology.
