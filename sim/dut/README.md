# `sim/dut/` — the device under test

Every testbench in `sim/` instantiates the DUT; **no testbench contains a
comparator netlist.** The binding lives in one file, [`sim/dut.json`](../dut.json),
and the harness (`sim/harness/dut.py`) includes it in every generated deck.

Today it points at [`placeholder_comparator.spice`](placeholder_comparator.spice) —
a deliberately crude stub on SG13G2's own `sg13_lv_nmos`/`sg13_lv_pmos`
devices whose only job is to prove the plumbing runs. It is **not** a copy
of `gf180-comparator`'s placeholder — see that file's header.

## What is bound here today

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `id` | `placeholder-v1` |
| `provenance` | **`placeholder`** |
| `netlist` | `sim/dut/placeholder_comparator.spice` |

`provenance: placeholder` is load-bearing: `sim/harness/report.py` puts a
banner at the top of **every** record produced under it saying the numbers
substantiate the harness and not a spec row. A placeholder measurement can
therefore never be quoted against `README.md`'s target-specification table by
accident.

## Why a placeholder exists at all

This repo's comparator topology is not decided. That decision is
[`spec/porting-plan.md`](../../spec/porting-plan.md) next step 1 and is
explicitly out of scope for the harness work (issue #8). But the harness
cannot be *proven* to work without something to simulate — "the four benches
would run once a design exists" is exactly the kind of untested claim this
repo's `CLAUDE.md` forbids ("no claim without a testbench").

So: a placeholder, loudly labelled, with real records committed against it,
and a one-line swap to the real design when it lands.

**The placeholder is not a topology proposal.** Its front end is a textbook
resistively-loaded NMOS pair at unconsidered sizing; its decision stage is
*behavioural* precisely so that it commits to no transistor topology at all.
Nothing about it should be read as pre-empting the decision record.

## Interface contract

A DUT netlist must define these three subcircuits with these pins, in this
order. `sim/harness/dut.py` checks it textually at load time and refuses a
mismatch — a silently reordered pin list would miswire all four benches into
plausible-looking wrong answers. **This is the one thing this repo keeps
IDENTICAL to `gf180-comparator`'s own contract** — `CLAUDE.md` states this
repo is a two-PDK twin with `gf180-comparator` and the benches must stay
structurally identical.

```
.subckt comparator_dut        vinp vinn clk ibias dout doutb vdd vss
.subckt comparator_dut_analog vinp vinn     ibias aop  aon   vdd vss
.subckt comparator_dut_latch  inp  inn  clk       dout doutb vdd vss
```

| pin | meaning |
|---|---|
| `vinp` / `vinn` | differential inputs. `v(vinp) > v(vinn)` ⇒ `dout` HIGH. |
| `clk` | decision strobe. LOW = reset, HIGH = evaluate. |
| `ibias` | bias-current input pin. The testbench forces `dut_ib` into it. |
| `dout` / `doutb` | complementary decision outputs, **held** between strobes. |
| `aop` / `aon` | front-end analog outputs. `v(aop) - v(aon) = +A_v·(v(vinp) - v(vinn))`. |
| `inp` / `inn` | decision-stage inputs — driven by `aop` / `aon` inside `comparator_dut`. |
| `vdd` / `vss` | supply and ground. |

The netlist must **not** contain `.include`, `.lib`, `.temp`, `.control`,
`.endc` or `.end` — the harness owns all of those (same rule as testbench
fragments), including the OSDI `pre_osdi` preflight SG13G2's PSP103-based
models need (`sim/harness/README.md` "OSDI preflight"). Operating-point
parameters come from `sim/dut.json`'s `params` map (`dut_ib`, `dut_vcm`), not
from the netlist.

### Why the DUT is split into three subckts, not one

Two of the four experiments — [`comparator-offset-mc`](../comparator-offset-mc/)
and [`comparator-preamp-noise`](../comparator-preamp-noise/) — are
**small-signal analyses about a DC operating point** (`dc` sweeps and
`.noise`). A reset-and-regenerate decision stage has no DC operating point,
so `.noise` returns nothing usable for a full latched comparator and a DC
offset sweep is meaningless on one. This is the same constraint
`gf180-sar-adc` (and, after it, `gf180-comparator`) documents at length in
its `sim/comparator-preamp-noise/` testbench header.

Exposing the DC-resolvable front end separately is how those two benches stay
`.noise`/`dc`-based. `comparator_dut_latch` exists for the same reason from
the other side: the noise bench instantiates it with `clk` held low so the
front end's noise bandwidth is set by the capacitance it *actually* drives,
rather than by a lumped capacitor somebody invented — under-loading that node
would raise the bandwidth and so **under-report** the noise.

**This split is the one assumption the contract makes about the topology**,
and it is stated here rather than buried. If the ratified topology turns out
to have no DC-resolvable front end at all — a bare dynamic latch, say — then
`comparator_dut_analog` cannot be provided honestly, and the offset-MC and
preamp-noise benches must be re-founded on transient Monte Carlo / transient
noise instead (thousands of trials per corner rather than one deterministic
analysis). That is a known, named consequence of the topology decision,
recorded here so the decision record can *weigh* it rather than discover it.
It is not a reason to fake a front end.

## Swapping in the real design

1. Commit the netlist (e.g. `design/comparator.spice`, or an xschem-generated
   netlist) satisfying the contract above, on SG13G2's own device primitives
   (`sg13_lv_nmos`/`sg13_lv_pmos`, or their HV counterparts if a decision
   record ratifies a mixed-rail topology).
2. Edit `sim/dut.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "netlist": "../design/comparator.spice",
     "id": "comparator-dr000N",
     "provenance": "schematic",
     "params": {"dut_ib": 1e-05, "dut_vcm": 0.6}
   }
   ```

3. `python3 sim/run_corners.py --check-env` — confirms the contract is met
   (and that the OSDI device models the new netlist needs are present; see
   `sim/harness/README.md`).
4. Re-run the four experiments (`sim/characterize.sh characterize`). The
   placeholder records stay in `records/` (evidence is append-only) but every
   new record is stamped `provenance: schematic` and carries no placeholder
   banner.

For a post-layout run, set `provenance` to `extracted` and point at the
extracted netlist; the record header distinguishes the two.
