# sim/selftest.sh -- the HARNESS's own acceptance test.
#
# This is not a circuit test. It answers one question: does the corner runner
# actually do what its records say it does? Ported in intent from
# gf180-comparator/sim/selftest.sh (itself ported from gf180-sar-adc).
#
# The failure this exists to catch is the one that leaves no trace: a runner
# that appears to sweep process corners (and, for comparator-offset-mc,
# mismatch draws) but simulates typical-and-mismatch-free everywhere (wrong
# .lib section, ignored parameter, misspelled corner name). Every number it
# produces looks reasonable; every record it writes is worthless.
#
# So the test is a NEGATIVE CONTROL. `--sabotage-corners` forces every corner
# bundle to plain `mos_tt` while keeping the corner NAMES. A bench whose
# anchor measurement carries a `min_spread_pct_by_axis[process]` floor MUST
# then fail. If it passes sabotaged, corner switching is not taking effect.
#
#   1. environment/OSDI/toolchain/DUT-contract check
#   2. every bench runs at the nominal point         (must PASS)
#   3. the anchored benches run sabotaged            (must FAIL)
#
# Exit 0 only if all three hold.
