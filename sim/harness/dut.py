"""The device-under-test binding.

Ported verbatim in structure from ``2AMLogic/gf180-comparator``'s
``sim/harness/dut.py`` (itself a deliberate structural divergence from
``gf180-sar-adc``'s harness, adopted here for the same reason): the DUT is
bound ONCE, in ``sim/dut.json``, and the harness includes it ahead of the
testbench fragment, rather than each testbench fragment carrying its own
copy of the comparator netlist. This repo's own topology is not yet decided
(``spec/porting-plan.md`` next step 1), so the harness has to be able to run
*before* a design exists and then accept the real design without editing
four testbenches.

Swapping the placeholder for the ratified design is a one-line edit of
``sim/dut.json``, not a four-way netlist copy -- and, critically, every
record the harness writes stamps ``dut_provenance``, so a number measured
against the placeholder can never be quoted as if it were measured against
the design.

The interface contract every DUT netlist must satisfy is documented in
``sim/dut/README.md`` and asserted (by name, not by simulation) here. The
pin contract itself (three subckts, exact pin order) is the one thing this
module keeps IDENTICAL to gf180-comparator's, by design: ``CLAUDE.md``
states this repo is a two-PDK twin with gf180-comparator and the benches
must stay structurally identical.
